                Wellp, now you did it. You broke your computer. You probably
                didn't even do anything major, did you? But see, I'm the dreaded
                Blue Screen of Death, and I pop up totally randomly, and most
                times, for no good gah-darn reason.

                You're probably sweatin' bullets right now, aren't you? I love
                it! So, there are a couple options you could try, neither of
                which will work whatsoever, but hey, be my guest.

                    Hit CTRL+ALT+DEL. This will restart me. But, everything
                    you've done on me up until this point will be gone. Womp,
                    womp. But if you're into downloading weird online GIF's
                    (which you are), I'm guessing this isn't a terrible option.

                    computer repair guy in town. All of 'em. Give'em all a shot.
                    It's fine. I'll wait. I ain't going anywhere. I can stay
